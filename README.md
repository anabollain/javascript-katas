# JavaScript Katas

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I've created this repository to gather all JS Katas and challenges that I will be doing. Most of them come from Code Wars, an incredible platform to practice your programming skills. 

I highly encourage you to try it if you haven't done it yet ðŸ˜Š

* [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/)

Each exercise will consist of a JS file, with the name and description on the top. I will be uploading the different solutions I come up with, as well as the official best voted solution available. 

In some cases, I will add comments that I have found useful to help me understand some of the steps. 

Hope you enjoy it, don't hesitate to contact me if you want to practice together or if I'm able to help you in any way!

Let's get coding âœ¨
